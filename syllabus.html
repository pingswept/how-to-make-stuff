    <h1>How To Make Stuff syllabus</h1>
    <h2>Course description</h2>
    <p>EN 0001: Applications in Engineering</p>
    <p>Section 11, class number 63539: How To Make Stuff</p>
    <p><a href="http://hwtmkstff.com">hwtmkstff.com</a></p>
    <p>Hands-on introduction to engineering fabrication. Project-based survey of prototyping and manufacturing methods, including lasercutting, 3D printing, and other modern CNC techniques, as well as methods from the molding, metalworking, and woodworking traditions. Tactical sorties into the realm of microcontrollers and embedded webservers, with an emphasis on open source hardware platforms.</p>
    <h2>Lecturer</h2>
    <p>Brandon Stafford, brandon.stafford@tufts.edu</p>
    <p>I check email in the morning.</p>
    <h2>Textbooks</h2>
    <p>There will be no textbook for the class. Instead, you will be asked to buy a small microcontroller, probably a Raspberry Pi 3, for around $35.</p>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>While there may occasionally be readings or other tasks asked of you, the majority of your effort in this class will be on project work. The class will culminate in final project covering the 4 weeks before Thanksgiving. After Thanksgiving, we'll concentrate on project documentation and solidifying what you've learned so far.</p>
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>There will be no quizzes or exams.</p>
    <p>Grades will be based on your project work.</p>
    <p>Did you build something? Did it work? Was it finely crafted? Did you work well with your teammates?</p>
    <h2>No electronics</h2>
    <p>Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we're using computers as tools for designing the stuff we're making.</p>
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p>Tu, Th 1:30PM - 2:45PM in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=m003">Anderson Hall</a>, 3rd floor, Room 306</p>
    <p>Project work will take place in the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/theshop/">Shop</a>, the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/designlab/">Design Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/instrumentation/">Instrumentation Lab</a>, all of which are in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=m008">Bray Lab</a>, 504 Boston Avenue.</p>
