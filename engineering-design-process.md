# Two approaches #

## The naive approach ##

In software, we call this "the waterfall method."

Here are the steps:

    1. Figure out what the thing needs to do, AKA "generating requirements"
    2. Design something with specifications that meet those requirements.
    3. Manufacture the thing.
    4. Test the thing.
    5. Manufacture a large quantity of the thing.
    6. Ship the thing.

Generally, this approach seems like it should work. Surprisingly, it usually does not.

## A more savvy approach ##

You could call this iterative design.

Here are the steps:

    1. Start with at least one basic requirement.
    2. Build a prototype quickly.
    3. Show the prototype to users.
    4. Add more requirements and return to step 2, (build a prototype).
    
Each iteration through the loop improves the quality of the prototype. After a few iterations, you can start making batches of prototypes ("alpha units" and then "beta units").
