In 1996, when I was just getting interested in engineering, I was talking to a friend about how he had designed the suspension for a racecar he was working on for a school project. I asked him, "Which is stronger, steel or aluminum?" He said something like, "Well, it depends on whether you just mean stiffer-- steel is stiffer than aluminum-- or do you mean strength to weight ratio? Aluminum is better for building light, stiff structures."

At the time, I thought my friend was trying to dodge the question. Just tell me which one is stronger! It turns out that there are subtle distinctions in what "strength" means.

Stiffness, hardness, toughness, strength-to-weight
