<h1>How To Make Stuff</h1>
<p><i>How To Make Stuff</i> is a class developed by Brandon Stafford. In the fall of 2016, it is being taught at Tufts University.</p>
<h2>More information</h2>

<h3>Notes from class #2</h3>
<p>The first two projects are designing stuff for lasercutting and 3D printing. There are more details on the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
<p>A few questions about CAD, lasercutting, and the like:</p>
<p><b>After I make a part in Onshape, how do I export it in a format I can use for lasercutting?</b>
<p> First, make a drawing that shows the top views of all the parts you want to lasercut. You'll probably want a custom drawing template with the border and title block not included, but you can always delete them after you export if that seems easier. To export, right-click on the Drawing tab at the bottom of the screen, choose Export, and then choose .DXF format.</p>
<p><b>What about for the 3D printer?</b></p>
<p>Right-click on the Part Studio tab, choose export, and then choose .STL format.</p>
<p><b>Hey, what are we doing next week, anyway? Should we meet in Anderson Hall or the shop? Do we need to bring our popsicle sticks?</b></p>
<p>On Tuesday and Thursday, Septemmber 13 and 15, we'll be meeting at the shop on the first floor of Bray Lab at 504 Boston Ave. I'll put a note up on the blackboard of Anderson 306, so if you forget, no big deal. Bray is <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=m008">just down the street a few buildings</a>. No need to bring your popsicle sticks until we go back to Anderson on September 20th the following week.</p>
<h3>Notes from class #1</h3>
<p>Think seriously about developing your engineering persona.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be open to critique.</li>
    <li>Criticize the design, not the person.</li>
    <li>Be specific in your criticism.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that Stuxnet was injecting commands into the PLC and masking that it was doing so was evidence that it was designed, not for espionage as everyone had believed, but for physical sabotage. The researchers were stunned. It was the first time anyone had seen digital code in the wild being used to physically destroy something in the real world.</p>
<p>The malware would sit quietly on the system doing reconnaissance for about two weeks, then launch its attack swiftly and quietly, increasing the frequency of the converters to 1,410Hz for 15 minutes, before restoring them to a normal frequency of 1,064Hz. The frequency would remain at this level for 27 days, before Stuxnet would kick in again and drop the frequency down to 2Hz for 50 minutes."</p>
