<h2>The first two projects</h2>
<p>The first two projects are designing stuff for lasercutting and 3D printing. The projects are due at the beginning of class on September 22 and September 29. To try to manage everyone trying to use the machines at once, we're splitting into two groups.
<h3>If your last name starts with a letter A-M:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>lasercut design due September 22</li>
    <li>3D print due September 29</li>
</ul>
<h3>If your last name starts with a letter N-Z:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3D print due September 22</li>
    <li>lasercut design due September 29</li>
</ul>
