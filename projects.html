<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>The first two projects</h2>
<p>The first two projects are designing stuff for lasercutting and 3D printing. The projects are due at the beginning of class on September 22 and September 29. To try to manage everyone trying to use the machines at once, we're splitting into two groups.
<h3>If your last name starts with a letter A-M:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>lasercut design due September 22</li>
    <li>3D print due September 29</li>
</ul>
<h3>If your last name starts with a letter N-Z:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3D print due September 22</li>
    <li>lasercut design due September 29</li>
</ul>
<h3>What exactly should we design?</h3>
<p>The 3D print can be anything small that you're excited about designing. It should be small because 3D printers are slow, and the real point here is for you  to learn CAD and gain some confidence using the 3D printer.</p>
<p>The lasercutter only cuts flat stuff, but you should design something 3-dimensional. You could do this by cutting a few 2D pieces and assembling them, or cutting one piece from a flexible material (say, paper or chipboard) and then folding it up. The point here is, like with the 3D printer, to get real experience with the machine, but also to push your CAD skills to make 2D parts mesh into a 3D object.
