<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>The first two projects</h2>
<p>The first two projects are designing stuff for lasercutting and 3D printing. To try to manage everyone trying to use the machines at once, we're splitting into two groups.
<h3>If your name doesn't put you in the group below:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>lasercut design due September 26</li>
    <li>3D print due October 3</li>
</ul>
<h3>If your name is Lauren, Ryan, Daniel B., Taylor, Sophie, Kyle, Harry, Joe P., Jake, Daniel M., Isabelle, Kate, or Thomas:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3D print due September 26</li>
    <li>lasercut design due October 3</li>
</ul>
<h3>What exactly should we design for the 3D printer?</h3>
<p>You should create a model of a Tufts building at a scale of 1:1000.</p>
<p>There are a few goals here.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Learn how to make a simplified model of something in the real world.</li>
    <li>Learn some basic CAD skills.</li>
    <li>Learn the basic routine of 3D printing.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will definitely have to go to a building, measure it with a tape measure (which I will lend to you), write down some numbers, and then go back to your computer and make a model. You might be able to capture some details by taking pictures, inserting them into the CAD model as underlays, and then tracing features in the pictures, but you'll find it's hard to get a picture that isn't distorted, especially with a cellphone camera.</p>
<p>You might think to yourself, "Ah, I'll choose a very small building. That should make it easier!" That's not really true-- if you want an easy project, choose a building with simple geometry. Feel free to ignore or approximate sloped basements and other weird contours along the ground. That stuff is difficult to capture in CAD, and if the bottom of your model isn't flat, you have to print your model upside down or waste a bunch of filament on support material. You can do that if you want, but it's probably not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Feel free to pick the same building as someone else in the class, but please don't share measurements or CAD models while the project is underway.</p>
<h3>And what about for the lasercutter?</h3>
<p>The lasercutter only cuts flat stuff, but you should design something 3-dimensional. You could do this by cutting a few 2D pieces and assembling them, or cutting one piece from a flexible material (say, paper or chipboard) and then folding it up. The point here is, like with the 3D printer, to get real experience with the machine, but also to push your CAD skills to make 2D parts mesh into a 3D object. You should expect to cut your project at least twice-- getting stuff to fit together right on the first try is unlikely.</p>
<h3>Some suggestions about materials</h3>
<p>For the 3D printer, the university will pay for filament, so you don't need to worry about that.</p>
<p>For the lasercutter, I'll order you a 12" x 24" sheet of 1/8" acrylic from <a href="http://www.delviesplastics.com/">Delvie's Plastics</a>. (I'll actually order 24" x 48" pieces and cut them down, if you're curious.) You can also use stuff like old cereal boxes, or any other non-corrugated cardboard you can find. If you want to buy some more exotic materials, you could try <a href="http://mcmaster.com">McMaster-Carr</a> or <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>. Remember to account for shipping time. Locally, you can also try Michaels Crafts in Porter Square.</p>
<p>In thinking about materials, you should also take into account the thickness of the material you're cutting in your CAD model. Sometimes 1/8" acrylic sheet is really 3 mm thick. You can measure your materials with the calipers in the shop to be sure. Also, make sure your material isn't too thick for the laser to cut through and make sure it's not something that emits poison when you cut it, like PVC. There's a list of allowed materials on <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/theshop/laser-cutter/">the Bray lasercutter page</a>.</p>
<h2>Project #3: Make an electromechanical PCB assembly</h2>
<p>You can make more or less whatever you want for this project, provided it has a mechanical element and contains a PCB. If you're not feeling creative, or you're struggling to keep up with your other classes, the baseline project is to make a fidget spinner that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>has some LEDs on it,</li>
    <li>has a microcontroller and battery on board, and</li>
    <li>has a skateboard bearing mounted in the center in a 3D-printed housing</li>
</ul>
<p>The due date is at the beginning of class on November 9, 2017. That means that by 3 PM on November 9, you should have submitted your design to <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a> for fabrication. (The PCBs will arrive in the mail later in November, and we'll assemble them after Thanksgiving, but that's not officially part of the project.)</p>
<h2>Final project: Make a mini-golf hole that talks to the internet</h2>
    <p>Due November 21, 2017. You'll work in teams of 2 or 3.</p>
<p>Make a mini-golf hole.</p>
<p>The hole will be a red Solo cup. The ball will be a PGA regulation golf ball.</p>
<p>At a minimum, your hole must have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>At least one hole</li>
    <li>At least one obstacle that makes the game challenging, but not impossible</li>
    <li>A Raspberry Pi brain that records a score of 100 points every time a ball goes in the hole.</li>
    <li>Also on the Pi, a web app that reports the current total score to any web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is hoped that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your mini-golf hole looks cool.</li>
    <li>Your mini-golf hole is fun to play.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<ul>
    <li>November 14: Design review in class. You and your 2 project-mates present a prototype of your design and receive polite critiques graciously.</li>
    <li>November 21 (right before Thanksgiving): Golf day in class. The public will be invited.</li>
</ul>
