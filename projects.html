<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>The first two projects</h2>
<p>The first two projects are designing stuff for lasercutting and 3D printing. The projects are due at the beginning of class on September 22 and September 29. To try to manage everyone trying to use the machines at once, we're splitting into two groups.
<h3>If your last name starts with one of the letters A-M:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>lasercut design due September 22</li>
    <li>3D print due September 29</li>
</ul>
<h3>If your last name starts with one of the letters N-Z:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3D print due September 22</li>
    <li>lasercut design due September 29</li>
</ul>
<h3>What exactly should we design?</h3>
<p>The 3D print can be anything small that you're excited about designing. It should be small because 3D printers are slow, and the real point here is for you  to learn CAD and gain some confidence using the 3D printer.</p>
<p>The lasercutter only cuts flat stuff, but you should design something 3-dimensional. You could do this by cutting a few 2D pieces and assembling them, or cutting one piece from a flexible material (say, paper or chipboard) and then folding it up. The point here is, like with the 3D printer, to get real experience with the machine, but also to push your CAD skills to make 2D parts mesh into a 3D object.</p>
<h3>Some suggestions about materials</h3>
<p>For the 3D printer, the university will pay for filament, so you don't need to worry about that.</p>
<p>For the lasercutter, you need to get the material yourself. The shop has some plastic scraps, but they're pretty small. You can also use stuff like old cereal boxes, or any other non-corrugated cardboard you can find. If you want to buy some materials, you could try <a href="http://mcmaster.com">McMaster-Carr</a> or <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>. For acrylic specifically, you could try <a href="http://www.delviesplastics.com/">Delvie's Plastics</a>, but remember to account for shipping time. Locally, you can also try Michaels Crafts in Porter Square. In thinking about materials, you should also take into account the thickness of the material you're cutting in your CAD model. Sometimes 1/8" acrylic sheet is really 3 mm thick. You can measure your materials with the calipers in the shop to be sure. Also, make sure your material isn't too thick for the laser to cut through and make sure it's not something that emits poison when you cut it, like PVC. There's a list of allowed materials on <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/theshop/laser-cutter/">the Bray lasercutter page</a>.</p>
