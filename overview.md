## Class #1 ##

### General expectations ###
* Welcome to college.
* Today: we talk about a few details; then we build stuff, then we talk about how to talk about building stuff.
* For next class: make an account at http://onshape.com and model a cube with a hole through it, or something more complicated if you like.
* Turn off cellphones and computers in class.
* br.st@tufts.edu, I check email in the morning.
* Your fellow students are a valuable resource because they're new to the material, like you, so they share your reference frame.

### Let's build ###

Build a track for a golf ball out of popsicle sticks.

### The role of failure in learning ###

On average, you will learn faster if you take big, risky steps, fail, and then recover, than if you take small, safe steps and never fail. 

### Being open to critique ###

* *Criticize the design, not the person.* When you feel criticized, check whether the target might be the design rather than you.
  * :heart: "I'm worried this part won't be strong enough." :heart:
  * :warning: "You're out of your mind! This will never work!" :warning:
* *Be specific in your criticism.* Try to anticipate failures and describe failure modes.
  * :heart: "I'm worried the wood will slide under the tape, and then the upper deck will collapse." :heart:
  * :warning: "This design is bad. So bad. It just is." :warning:

## Class #2 ##

Last time: Popsicle sticks and how we talk about building stuff.
This time: Drawing, CAD modeling, requirements and specifications.

### Technical drawing on paper ###

* You might think that, "I'm just not good at drawing." Note that almost everyone thinks that, even the people who are really skilled. It's scary to make a drawing and then show it to lots of people.
* Learning technical drawing makes you a faster, clearer, more efficient communicator. 

### 3D CAD with Onshape ###

* Chrome or Chromium will run a little faster than Firefox. Internet Explorer won't work right, as usual.
* Parametric modeling; explanation of how you can get into trouble
* Parts, part studios, assemblies, drawings
* Underdefined, overdefined, reference dimensions

It might seem like a CAD model could define a part completely, but it omits data about tolerances. In real life, parts you make aren't perfectly formed, and it costs more money to make parts more perfect.

### Some mechanical tolerances for parts the size of your hand ###

* Woodworking tools, hand tools used by a skilled person: good to within 30 mil (~ 1/32")
* Machine tools, like a milling machine amateurs get to touch: 5 mil (0.005")
* Machine tools so expensive we aren't allowed to touch them: 1 mil (0.001")
* Wire EDM: 0.1 mil (0.0001", 100 microinches)
* Polishing machine used to make gyroscope rotors for Gravity Probe B: 0.0003 mil (0.0000003", 0.3 microinches)
