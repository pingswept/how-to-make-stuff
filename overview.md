## Class #1 ##

### General expectations ###
* Welcome to college.
* Today: we talk about a few details; then we build stuff, then we talk about how to talk about building stuff.
* For next class: make an account at http://onshape.com and model a cube with a hole through it, or something more complicated if you like.
* Turn off cellphones and computers in class.
* br.st@tufts.edu, I check email in the morning.
* Your fellow students are a valuable resource because they're new to the material, like you, so they share your reference frame.

### Let's build ###

Build a track for a golf ball out of popsicle sticks.

### Being open to critique ###

* *Criticize the design, not the person.* When you feel criticized, check whether the target might be the design rather than you.
  * :heart: "I'm worried this part won't be strong enough." :heart:
  * :warning: "You're out of your mind! This will never work!" :warning:
* *Be specific in your criticism.* Try to anticipate failures and describe failure modes.
  * :heart: "I'm worried the wood will slide under the tape, and then the upper deck will collapse." :heart:
  * :warning: "This design is bad. So bad. It just is." :warning:
