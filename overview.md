## Class #1 ##

### General expectations ###
* Welcome to college.
* Today: we talk about a few details; then we build stuff, then we talk about how to talk about building stuff.
* For next class: make an account at http://onshape.com and model a cube with a hole through it, or something more complicated if you like.
* Turn off cellphones and computers in class.
* br.st@tufts.edu, I check email in the morning.
* Your fellow students are a valuable resource because they're new to the material, like you, so they share your reference frame.

### Let's build ###

Build a track for a golf ball out of popsicle sticks.

### Being open to critique ###

* Criticize the design, not the person. When you feel criticized, check whether the target might be the design rather than you.
* Be specific in your criticism. Try to anticipate failures and describe failure modes.
