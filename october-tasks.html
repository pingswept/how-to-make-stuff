<h1>Stuff you should do by October 17, 2017</h1>
<p>If you are in How To make Stuff in 2017, you should do the following things before class on October 17.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Obtain a Raspbery Pi Zero W. The cheapest way to do this is to buy one for $4.99 at <a href="http://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/cambridge.aspx">Microcenter in Cambridge</a>, but they will only sell you one at that price. If you're short on time and can spare a few dollars, you can order one from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400">Adafruit for $10 plus shipping</a>.</li>
    <li>If you have a Windows 10 computer, install the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> and <a href="https://conemu.github.io/">ConEmu</a>. You will know that you have succeeded when you can execute two commands: git and ssh.</li>
    <li>If you have an older Windows computer, send me an email, and I'll help you install Cygwin (or you can give it a try, if you're brave).</li>
    <li>If you have a Mac, install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>.</li>
    <li>If you have a Linux computer, install <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> using your package manager.</li>
    <li>Register for a <a href="https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/account">Microsoft Imagine account</a>.</li>
</ul>
